# ResumeAnalysis.AI
Here I am building an AI application that can analyze Resume and Job descriptions and draw insights

-Files that we intend to creat are ''app.py'' with another file as ''analysis.py'' that can have the prompts and genai model followed by ''pdf.py'' which will capture the pdf file and extract the resume text
-''.env'' to store the gemini api key
-'' requirement.txt'' to store the libraries needed for the app.

-- Activate venv using the following code:
''source .venv/Scripts/activate''
''pip install -r requirements.txt''
